          <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
          <p>
            Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
            Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the
            River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
            number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the
            rugged beauty of the river that they never left. Herds of elk and
            deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn
            sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined
            with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches
            in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon
            is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a
            free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
            early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There
            are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to
            swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

            <HR>HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE PAST SEASON</HR>
            <p>
                What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. The season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.

            <HR>ENCOUNTERS IN THE WILD!</HR>
            <p>
                Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States. We share these areas with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should find yourself face to face with one.

                Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being harmless. There are, however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can be found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment. The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States. Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and luckily humans are not on that list!

          <h3>FAQ</h3>
          <p>
            <li>Is this a good trip for kids?</li>
            What are the age ranges you allow? Absolutely this is a good trip
            for children of all ages. We have found however that children over
            the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially
            enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we
            get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a
            boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored
            children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of
            the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might
            see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things
            very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has
            been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all
            without telling stories...some of which are even true!
            <li>
              Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I
              still come?
            </li>
            As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed
            element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all
            certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3
            years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns
            and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting
            trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation
            device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great
            time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk
            before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and
            do in the event that you fall out of the raft. What is included in
            the trip? We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This
            includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small
            waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping
            chair. We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea
            and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours.
            You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2
            cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night before
            the trip, or on your way to the put-in.
            <li>3 meals per day, plus snacks What do I need to bring?</li>
            The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes
            in the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet
            Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring ponchos Quick dry shirts
            and shorts long sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you cooler
            on hot days. Button down shirts provide more sun protection on the
            neck Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pant or Sarong the best thing
            for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts if you are cold natured,
            bring polypropylene long underwear top and bottom Women wear swim
            suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer during
            the day. Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and
            the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if
            you are hot). Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing or
            going to the bathroom. hat- large brim hat offers protection from
            the sun with a good quality strap. Sunglasses with strap socks- used
            for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun. sandals or water
            shoes- if not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you
            have hiked in before camper wear: Bring something comfortable to
            wear around camp. Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs are all popular
            options. Sleep wear: You might choose to sleep in your camp wear.
            Otherwise, you might like to bring something comfortable to sleep
            in. water bottle small day pack for hikes moisturizing lotion
            headlamp or flashlight moleskin waterproof sunscreen and lip balm
            optional items: gloves fleece jacket towel bandana small pillow
            hygiene products: toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers,
            feminine hygiene products, extra eyeglasses or contacts,
            biodegradable soap and shampoo camera equipment book, watercolors,
            journal and pen
            <li>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</li>
            Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater
            rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river. Arise in the
            soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a
            beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh
            blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and
            prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of
            swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and
            more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up
            your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the
            river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your
            dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled
            salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven
            brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be
            able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to
            bed under more stars than you thought were possible.
            <li>How far in advance should I book my trip?</li>
            If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in
            advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually
            sufficient.
